## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Personal time journal** — a new Chinese-first daily workspace provides manual activity timing, local persistence, category allocation, a chronological timeline, and editable time records.
- **Floating time island** — active journal sessions can move into a translucent, top-centered compact window with pause, resume, end, restore, and drag controls.

### Changed

- **The normal desktop window now opens as a responsive workspace** — the default 980×720 canvas gives the daily journal room to expand while retaining a 340×470 resizable minimum.
- **Compact mode now preserves always-on-top preferences** — the island is forced above other windows only while compact mode is active, then restores the user's saved preference.

## [26.7.3] - 2026-07-30

### Added

- **Build-artifact cleanup is available from the development menu** — `scripts/dev-full.sh` now exposes a confirmed menu action and a non-interactive `--clean` flag that delegate to `pnpm clean` for renderer and Tauri build outputs.
- **OpenSpec update-plan review is documented** — the canonical agent flow now records experimental `/opsx:update` and `/opsx-update` aliases for reviewing and reconciling an existing operational change without implementation.

### Fixed

- **In-app updater eligibility now matches published releases** — only Windows NSIS and Linux AppImage bundles can use the signed updater flow; unsupported channels keep the release-page fallback.
- **Moving an active task no longer interrupts focus** — cross-list drag-and-drop now preserves the task selection in its destination list.

### Changed

- **Release operations now describe the signed updater payloads actually published by CI** — x86_64 archive assets, feed entry checks, single-platform dispatch conditions, and local preflight limitations are explicit.
- **Verified maintenance residue was removed** — unused renderer code, direct JavaScript dependencies, stale translations, Yarn artifacts, and obsolete Rust comparison scripts were removed without changing active native plugins.
- **Project dependencies were refreshed** — the pnpm pin, JS runtime/tooling packages, and Rust serialization/dialog crates were updated across the manifests, workflow pins, and lockfiles without intentional behavior changes.

## [26.7.2] - 2026-07-10

### Fixed

- **Task transfer file access is now native-authorized** — task import and export select and access files entirely inside the Tauri backend, removing renderer-controlled generic JSON file commands.
- **External Settings links open again** — the opener capability now authorizes the existing `http` and `https` URL scope without restoring file-reveal permissions.

## [26.7.1] - 2026-07-02

### Fixed

- **Audit hardening protects corrupted local state** — malformed `state` or `statistics` storage is now detected distinctly from missing data and preserved under a backup key before defaults can replace it.
- **Tauri JSON import/export commands are stricter** — native file commands now reject final file symlinks, retain JSON/size guardrails, and bound renderer-originated native payloads.
- **Release automation now avoids partial updater feeds** — version sync includes the local Cargo lock package version, PowerShell release validation matches the Unix order, and `latest.json` generation requires both active updater platforms.
- **Timer/task audit regressions were addressed** — special breaks trigger within their configured window once per day, and automatic daily color cleanup no longer pollutes task undo history.

### Changed

- **CI and operational docs were aligned with audit findings** — Rust CI gates now better match local preflight expectations, release docs no longer require a custom `GH_TOKEN` secret, and version/roadmap/handoff references were refreshed.
- **Project dependencies were refreshed** — pnpm, JS tooling/runtime packages, Rust Tauri/log crates, and cargo-audit transitives were updated without intentional behavior changes; remaining `quick-xml` RustSec advisories are temporarily ignored while blocked by upstream Tauri/plist constraints.

## [26.6.3] - 2026-06-16

### Fixed

- **Release uploads now use the GitHub Actions token** — the release workflow no longer depends on the custom `GH_TOKEN` secret for GitHub Release uploads, preventing Windows asset upload failures with `HTTP 401: Bad credentials` when that secret is expired or revoked.

## [26.6.2] - 2026-06-16

### Added

- **Development script contract was standardized** — `scripts/dev.sh` now exposes the `setup`, `up`, `check`, `build`, `update`, `status`, and `menu` verbs, while the new `scripts/dev-full.sh` owns the rich local validation menu.
- **Version tracking documentation was added** — `docs/VERSIONS.md` records the local runtime, app, and dependency version policy for future update audits.

### Changed

- **Legacy validation entry point is now a transition alias** — `scripts/validar-tudo.sh` delegates to `scripts/dev-full.sh` in non-interactive mode so existing callers keep working while documentation moves to the new script names.
- **Release and local tooling references now use the new validation script names** — release, update-check, uninstall, contributor, and agent documentation now point to `dev-full.sh`/`dev.sh` where appropriate.
- **Project dependencies were refreshed** — pnpm, JS tooling/runtime packages, CI Corepack pins, and the Rust `log` crate were updated without intentional behavior changes.

## [26.6.1] - 2026-06-01

### Added

- **CI now audits Rust dependencies for advisories** — a new `tauri-rust-audit` job runs `cargo audit --deny warnings`, failing on any new vulnerability or unmaintained/unsound advisory; a `src-tauri/.cargo/audit.toml` ignore-list silences the pre-existing GTK3/transitive warnings that ship with Tauri.
- **Rust backend has its first unit tests** — `window_bridge.rs` now covers the `.json` import/export extension guard (case-insensitive, rejecting other extensions), the 5 MiB import size limit, and the window-dimension constants; the `tauri-rust-check` job runs `cargo test`.
- **Standalone Rust update-check scripts** — `scripts/check_rust.sh` (root-deps logic from `check-updates.sh`) and `scripts/check_rust_2.sh` (bash port of the PowerShell checker, scoped to `src-tauri`).

### Changed

- **Rust dependencies refreshed** — the global-shortcut plugin and transitive crate pins were updated without intentional behavior changes (verified with `cargo fmt`/`clippy`/`check`/`audit` and a runtime smoke test).
- **Toolchain pins refreshed** — the pnpm pin was bumped across workflows and `packageManager`, and dev/runtime tooling pins were refreshed.

## [26.5.13] - 2026-05-25

### Changed

- **Task grid priority view now has three modes** — the priority toolbar button now cycles through normal grid order, prioritized-first layout, and prioritized-only filtering while keeping the grouped/ungrouped control independent; the filtered mode uses the same yellow star color as priority cards with a light outline for contrast.
- **Task grid storage migration is now cleaned up** — the legacy `tasks-grid-priority-filter` value is removed after migrating to the new `tasks-grid-priority-display` key.

## [26.5.12] - 2026-05-22

### Changed

- **Libraries were updated** — project library pins were refreshed without intentional behavior changes.

### Fixed

- **Statistics milestone badges align with their metric columns** — milestone chips in the progress overview now use the same two-column rhythm as the progress metric cards and center their label text within each rounded badge.

## [26.5.11] - 2026-05-18

### Changed

- **Task grid columns can be set to four** — the shared grid columns selector now includes a `4` option for both normal and compact task grids.
- **Task grid cards read better in dense layouts** — list names now render as compact labels with stronger contrast, task text keeps normal body text styling, and cards expose the full list/task text in their tooltip.
- **Dead grid hint text and renderer debug logs were cleaned up** — an unused compact grid hint translation and a committed renderer console log were removed, and the log filename is now ignored.
- **Task lists can be reordered by priority** — each List view action menu can move starred tasks to the top of that list while leaving lists without starred tasks unchanged.
- **Task list actions no longer show the legacy priority-list shortcut** — the obsolete list-level action was removed from the List view actions menu, unused option styles were removed, and the Timer task picker no longer uses priority-list wording.
- **Rust update checks ignore invalid compatibility placeholders** — `scripts/check-updates.sh` now treats `cargo outdated` compatibility values such as `---` as unavailable, preventing them from being offered as Rust update targets.
- **Tooling dependencies were refreshed** — project tooling pins were updated without intentional behavior changes.

## [26.5.10] - 2026-05-18

### Changed

- **Task grid Auto columns use a shared minimum card width** — normal and compact grids now use the same `11rem` Auto column threshold and horizontal content padding, reducing layout differences between the two views.
- **Libraries were updated** — project library pins were refreshed without intentional behavior changes.

## [26.5.9] - 2026-05-15

### Fixed

- **Task grid columns control stays right-aligned on narrow layouts** — the grid toolbar now keeps the columns selector aligned to the right edge instead of placing it beside the left toolbar actions.
- **Task grid reset action is ordered after draw and grouping** — the reset-colors button now appears as the third toolbar icon instead of the first.
- **Statistics opened from compact mode return to compact Timer** — returning from the report to the Timer now restores compact mode instead of leaving the app in the normal layout.
- **Task completion reducers now handle missing card IDs consistently** — the done and not-done reducers now share the same no-op behavior when a card ID is absent.

## [26.5.8] - 2026-05-14

### Added

- **Task grid priorities** — task cards can now be marked as priorities from the grid, pending priorities appear in a dedicated top section in both normal and compact grids, the grid toolbar can switch to prioritized-only mode, and task import/export preserves the new priority flag while remaining compatible with older task files.
- **Priority cards keep stable sizing while grouping changes** — toggling the grid group mode no longer changes the size of cards inside the `Priorities` section, while the remaining task groups still follow the selected grouping layout.
- **Priority cards are visually separated from the rest of the grid** — when pending priorities are shown in the ungrouped grid, a divider now separates the priority section from the remaining cards.
- **Draw can be limited to prioritized tasks** — Settings now includes a `Draw only prioritized tasks` option below the grid Draw button toggle; when enabled in all-task mode, Draw uses only prioritized eligible cards and falls back to the normal draw pool when no prioritized card is available. The visual prioritized-only filter keeps Draw limited to the visible grid pool.
- **Task priorities can be toggled from List view** — task cards in the List view now expose the same priority star near the drag handle, away from edit/delete actions, and dragging a prioritized task between lists preserves the priority flag.

### Changed

- **Dependencies were refreshed** — selected JS tooling pins and transitive Rust dependency pins were updated, including Rust updates that resolve current `cargo audit` vulnerability errors, without intentional behavior changes.

### Fixed

- **Version and release dry-runs no longer prompt for a version** — `scripts/version.sh --dry-run` and `scripts/release.sh --dry-run` now use the suggested version automatically when no version is provided.
- **Cargo update checks find user-installed tools consistently** — `scripts/check-updates.sh` now adds `$CARGO_HOME/bin` or `~/.cargo/bin` to its local `PATH` before checking for `cargo-audit` and `cargo-outdated`.
- **Compact focus-extension prompt keeps its expanded height while task controls are clicked** — when `Continue focusing?` is visible in compact mode, task footer panel controls are disabled so the grid/actions/dropdown cannot collapse the prompt-sized window.
- **Development validation aborts when the local install is already running** — `scripts/validar-tudo.sh` now stops before opening the dev runtime or local release binary if the locally installed Pomodoroz binary is open, preventing the installed window from being mistaken for the test runtime.

## [26.5.7] - 2026-05-12

### Fixed

- **Compact task grid now grows when the compact window is resized taller** — dragging the lower window edge while the compact grid is open gives the extra height to the task grid, and reopening the grid keeps the manually adjusted height during the current app session.

### Changed

- **Dependencies were refreshed** — project dependency pins were updated without intentional behavior changes.

## [26.5.6] - 2026-05-11

### Added

- **Report now separates period metrics from long-term progress** — the Statistics screen keeps the period filter tied to focus time, break time, idle time, completed cycles, top focus areas, and daily flow while showing streak, level, XP progress, today's target, explicit milestones, a 30-day heatmap, and last-7-day focus bars from the existing local history without adding new storage fields.

### Changed

- **Period selector is scoped to the report section** — the period dropdown now sits inside the period report header, and the objective metric cards remain visible before the progress section to avoid mixing filtered report data with fixed-range habit data.
- **Daily report windows now align with calendar days** — week and month report data use the same local-day range as the daily flow chart, and the daily flow bars now read oldest to newest for fixed period windows.
- **Rust dependency updates prepare selected manifest pins before lockfile updates** — the update checker now adjusts all selected root crate pins in `Cargo.toml` before running `cargo update`, avoiding transient conflicts for exact-pinned dependency pairs such as `tauri` and `tauri-build`.
- **Statistics screen starts with the filter and metrics** — the redundant visual report heading, summary heading, and filter label were removed while keeping accessible labels for assistive technology.
- **Statistics translations were cleaned up** — an obsolete clear-confirmation message was removed from all locale files.

## [26.5.5] - 2026-05-06

### Fixed

- **Fullscreen break now brings background Tauri windows forward before taking over the screen** — entering a fullscreen break now unminimizes, shows, focuses, and temporarily raises the window when it was minimized outside the tray or already visible behind other apps, then restores the user's Always On Top setting on exit.

## [26.5.4] - 2026-05-06

### Fixed

- **Timer task controls open in the right direction for each window mode** — normal mode task overlays open above the footer without clipping, compact mode task actions use a shorter expanded panel below the footer, and priority lists still use the taller grid-sized panel when more room is useful.
- **Active task highlight in the grid is subtler** — the running task marker now changes only the card's existing border color, without adding an extra ring or drop shadow, in both the standard and compact grids.
- **Rust release preflight is formatted cleanly** — the Tauri command imports now match `cargo fmt`, preventing `release.sh` from stopping during the local Rust quality gate.

### Changed

- **Dependencies were updated in a package refresh** — no functional behavior change is intended.

## [26.5.3] - 2026-05-05

### Fixed

- **Compact Timer keeps the clock visible again** — compact mode now reserves a stable clock column and centers the counter text without clipping, preserving the flush task footer layout introduced in 26.5.1.

## [26.5.2] - 2026-05-05

### Changed

- **Renderer test tooling now uses Vitest for functional tests only** — Jest-specific packages and direct Babel test dependencies were removed, Vitest scripts were added, CI now runs only the renderer functional test suite, and local validation/install flows gate builds on the same functionality tests.

## [26.5.1] - 2026-05-04

### Fixed

- **Release script now explains missing changelog version headers before syncing manifests** — `release.sh` validates both changelogs before `version:sync`, prints the nearest version headers when the requested version is missing, and no longer emits unrelated login-shell profile noise for internal commands.
- **Scrollable app areas now use the same visible thin scrollbar style** — Tasks Grid, main scrollable views, task details, text areas, and timer task menus no longer mix hidden, hover-only, and thicker native scrollbar appearances.
- **Update checks no longer suggest manual Rust updates when root crates are current** — the Cargo section now hides generic manual commands when `cargo outdated` succeeds and reports no root crate updates.
- **Update checks now offer and apply Rust patch/minor root crate updates correctly** — `check-updates` now treats `cargo outdated` `latest` patch/minor results as safe candidates when `compat` is unavailable, updates exact Cargo manifest pins before refreshing the lockfile, and makes the JS/Tauri recommendation wait for Rust alignment when needed.
- **Compact timer footer now sits flush with the window edge** — compact mode now lets the Timer fill the available window height and anchors the task footer to the bottom, removing the small background gap below the footer.
- **Windows release publishing no longer aborts when the GitHub Release is not created yet** — the release workflow now treats a missing release as an expected creation path in PowerShell and tolerates Linux/Windows jobs racing to create the same release.

### Changed

- **Tauri dependencies were kept aligned across JS and Rust** — the JS `@tauri-apps/*` updates are paired with matching Rust crate updates so `tauri dev` no longer reports a Tauri package version mismatch.
- **pnpm version pin is now declared and maintained consistently** — `package.json` now declares `packageManager`, and `check-updates` can compare/update the manifest pin alongside workflow Corepack pins.

## [26.4.39] - 2026-04-29

### Fixed

- **Compact task continuation prompt no longer nudges the compact window size** — the Continue/Switch footer now shares the same fixed row height as the normal compact task footer and truncates long task text inside that space.
- **Normal Timer layout can no longer be resized below its supported size** — the Tauri window now enforces a normal-mode minimum size while compact mode keeps its own smaller limit, preventing the timer circle from overlapping navigation, session text, and playback controls.

### Changed

- **README language documentation is now clearer** — the Pomatez vs Pomodoroz table now summarizes supported language coverage by count, and the language list reflects all 7 supported locales.

## [26.4.38] - 2026-04-27

### Added

- **Focus sessions can now be extended near completion** — a new opt-in Focus Extension setting shows a non-modal `+short` / `+long` prompt during the final 30 seconds of focus, temporarily expands compact mode when needed, uses configurable extension durations in Config/Rules, allows one extension per focus block, and sends a native reminder when the app is in the background and notifications are enabled.
- **Theme shortcut customization now persists** — the app-owned `Toggle Theme` shortcut can now be changed in Settings, stored with local settings, restored on startup, and protected against invalid or reserved shortcut conflicts.

### Fixed

- **Focus extension polish after review** — extension usage tracking now has a single source of truth, and German focus-extension copy now uses native spelling for `Verlängerung` / `verlängern`.

### Changed

- **Grid study helpers are now enabled by default** — new/restored profiles now show the grid draw button and rotate grid colors by default.
- **Dependencies were updated in a patch refresh** — no functional behavior change is intended.
- **Manual updater prompt state was simplified** — release-note body storage was removed from the renderer update state and IPC payload because the manual prompt now stays focused on the available version and install choice.
- **Local uninstall scripts can now remove generated installer artifacts** — `scripts/uninstall.sh` and `scripts/uninstall.ps1` gained an installer cleanup mode for `src-tauri/target/release/bundle`, matching the local output produced by `validar-tudo --installers`.

## [26.4.37] - 2026-04-25

### Fixed

- **Native integration warnings no longer appear for optional background sync failures** — tray, autostart, tray-icon, and update-policy sync errors remain logged for diagnosis but no longer show the generic Tauri warning banner on startup.

### Changed

- **Renderer CSP is now explicit in Tauri configuration** — `app.security.csp` now defines a conservative packaged policy, `devCsp` preserves local Vite/Tauri development needs, and the broad HTML meta CSP was removed from renderer templates.
- **Small renderer dead-code residues were removed** — unused timer spacer marker classes and the unconsumed `openExternalCallback` connector prop were removed without changing user-facing behavior.

## [26.4.36] - 2026-04-25

### Fixed

- **Native Tauri command failures are now visible in the UI** — asynchronous `TauriInvokeConnector.send()` failures now notify the connector provider, allowing the existing native integration warning to appear instead of leaving failures only in console logs.

### Changed

- **Renderer version display no longer imports the root package manifest** — Vite now injects the app version at build time, and titlebar/settings version labels consume the shared `APP_VERSION` constant instead of bundling `package.json`.
- **Claude Code guidance was aligned with the current Tauri-only architecture** — `CLAUDE.md` now reflects the ESLint 10 / `@eslint-react` lint stack, the full `de`/`fr` language coverage, and the current connector bridge after removal of the legacy runtime router.

## [26.4.35] - 2026-04-24

### Fixed

- **Manual update prompts no longer depend on release-note body text** — update availability now uses `updateVersion`, so the install prompt and navigation indicator remain available even when the updater feed has an empty body.

### Changed

- **Manual update mode now asks before installing** — when automatic update installation is disabled, the app shows a localized `Update now` / `Not now` prompt instead of replacing Settings with the updater screen.
- **Automatic update wording was clarified and shortened across all translations** — the setting keeps the automatic-update meaning while fitting narrow settings rows and compact prompts better.
- **Updater channel support checks are memoized per runtime session** — repeated updater actions now reuse the resolved `is_updater_channel_supported` result while preserving safe `false` fallback behavior on native errors.
- **Improvements roadmap was synchronized after the updater block** — `docs/IMPROVEMENTS.md` now marks `A13` as delivered, queues IPC error visibility, `A7`, CSP/cleanup, and `A3` as the next technical sequence, and returns unfinished product items to `Open`.
- **pnpm workflow pin management was aligned across CI and release checks** — CI now uses the same `pnpm@10.33.2` pin as the release workflow, and `check-updates.sh` now reports and can update all workflow pnpm pins together while giving clearer Manjaro/Arch guidance when the active `pnpm` binary differs from the system package.

## [26.4.34] - 2026-04-24

### Changed

- **Project dependencies were updated in a maintenance batch** — no functional behavior changes are intended.
- **CI now includes Windows parity quality checks** — `.github/workflows/ci.yml` now runs renderer quality gates and Tauri `cargo check` on `windows-latest` in addition to existing Linux jobs, with successful workflow execution in both lanes.
- **Tauri export write bridge now uses defensive input validation** — `write_text_file` now enforces `.json` extension, rejects existing non-file targets, and limits payload size to 5 MB to align with import/read hardening.

## [26.4.33] - 2026-04-23

### Changed

- **Auto-language detection now uses the official Tauri OS plugin in the renderer** — `detectSystemLanguage` now resolves locale through `@tauri-apps/plugin-os` (`locale()`) with safe browser fallback only when native locale is unavailable.
- **i18n bootstrap/sync flow was adapted for async locale resolution** — renderer language initialization now starts with synchronous fallback and reconciles to native locale asynchronously in auto mode, preserving manual language behavior.
- **Tray startup locale source was unified with renderer architecture** — native startup copy resolution now uses `tauri_plugin_os::locale()` instead of reading `LC_ALL`/`LC_MESSAGES`/`LANG` directly.
- **Tauri capabilities now explicitly include OS plugin permissions** — `src-tauri/capabilities/default.json` now grants `os:default` for locale access.
- **Improvements roadmap synchronized with A9 delivery** — `docs/IMPROVEMENTS.md` now marks locale-source unification as completed and updates next execution order after `26.4.32`.
- **Locale architecture rationale is now explicit in docs** — `docs/IMPROVEMENTS.md` and `docs/LANGUAGE_EXPANSION_GUIDE.md` now document why A9 was executed (startup consistency in auto mode, reduced drift risk, and official Tauri plugin alignment), not only what changed.

## [26.4.32] - 2026-04-21

### Fixed

- **In-app updater now blocks installer flow on unsupported runtime channels** — local Linux installs generated from `--no-bundle` no longer attempt `downloadAndInstall`; updater actions now fall back to opening the release page when the current bundle type does not support installer replacement.

### Changed

- **Updater channel support is now explicitly checked in the native bridge** — new command `is_updater_channel_supported` was added and wired through the Tauri invoke handler to keep updater behavior aligned with the running package type.
- **Local install scripts now state updater-channel limitations clearly** — `scripts/install.sh` and `scripts/install.ps1` now print that `--no-bundle` local installs do not run automatic in-app installer updates.

## [26.4.31] - 2026-04-21

### Fixed

- **Automatic cycle-end transitions are now resilient to timer state races** — `CounterContext` now manages/clears break-transition timeout through a single ref plus lifecycle cleanup, preventing stale delayed execution after reset/reconfigure/unmount.
- **Global `Escape` listener in the special-break setter is no longer always active** — keyboard handler registration in `SpecialField` now happens only while the setter popup is open.
- **Button ripple positioning was fixed for scroll scenarios** — `useRippleEffect` now uses `clientX/clientY` with `getBoundingClientRect()`.
- **Local persistence now flushes defensively on WebView lifecycle events** — debounced `store.subscribe` writes are now flushed on `beforeunload`, `pagehide`, and `visibilitychange`, reducing last-state loss on fast shutdown.

### Changed

- **Special-break setter moved to full i18n coverage (pt/en/es/ja/zh)** — hardcoded strings were replaced with translation keys across all supported languages.
- **Short-break config contract normalized** — typo action `setShorBreak` was renamed to `setShortBreak` (slice and consumers), with no intended behavior change.
- **Orphan `restartTimer` action removed from the `timer` slice** — dead renderer path was removed to reduce misuse surface.
- **Tauri `read_text_file` command hardened for task import flow** — file reads now enforce `.json` extension, reject non-file paths, and cap payload size (5 MB).
- **Technical roadmap updated with explicit renderer-versioning follow-up** — `docs/IMPROVEMENTS.md` now includes item `A7` to migrate UI version display away from `package.json` bundle dependency in a future cycle.
- **EN/PT READMEs now include an objective Pomatez vs Pomodoroz comparison** — added a compact table section outlining architecture, stack, and feature differences.
- **Language coverage expanded with German and French (`de`/`fr`)** — `LanguageCode`, settings validation, `supportedLanguages`, i18n resources, and full translation files were updated to support both locales in the renderer.
- **Tauri tray localization now matches new locales from native startup** — renderer `TRAY_COPY_BY_LANGUAGE` was extended and Rust startup fallback (`resolve_tray_copy`) now recognizes `es/zh/ja/pt/de/fr` (with safe `en` fallback).
- **Operational guide for adding future languages was documented** — new `docs/LANGUAGE_EXPANSION_GUIDE.md` lists required files, implementation steps, and post-deployment verification checks.
- **Changelog naming was standardized to make English the primary release source** — `CHANGELOG.en.md` was promoted to `CHANGELOG.md`, Portuguese moved to `CHANGELOG.pt.md`, and release scripts/docs were updated to validate both files under the new names.

## [26.4.30] - 2026-04-20

### Changed

- **IPC contract simplified after Tauri-only consolidation** — removed `INVOKE_MAIN` channel/types and dropped the `invoke` method from `InvokeConnector`, eliminating a dead path with no renderer consumers.
- **Compact-window auto-expand for dialogs consolidated in a shared hook** — duplicated temporary expand/collapse logic (`Control` and `TaskListGrid`) was centralized in `useCompactAutoExpand`, reducing flow drift and avoiding unintended collapse when compact mode is turned off while a prompt is open.
- **`ConfirmDialog` focus accessibility strengthened** — added `Tab`/`Shift+Tab` focus trap, initial auto-focus on cancel when opening, `aria-describedby` for message semantics, and focus restoration to the triggering element on close.
- **Grid columns selector in dark mode fixed** — the `Columns` dropdown in `TaskListGrid` now applies native appearance reset (`appearance: none`) and a custom CSS chevron to prevent white background rendering and keep dark theme consistency.

## [26.4.29] - 2026-04-20

### Changed

- **Project dependency updates** — a maintenance batch was applied across JS/TS ecosystem libraries, with no planned functional behavior change.
- **TypeScript lint dependencies updated (`@typescript-eslint/*` 8.59.0)** — `@typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin` and `@typescript-eslint/parser` were upgraded to `8.59.0`, with lockfile refresh.
- **Renderer env hygiene simplified** — `app/renderer/.env.example` was removed and the `!.env.example` exception was dropped from `.gitignore`; the renderer does not consume `SKIP_PREFLIGHT_CHECK`, `BROWSER`, or `CI` in the default runtime/build path, keeping `.env` as optional local-only config.
- **A5 batch 2 completed (`eslint`/`@eslint/js` 10.x + `eslint-react`)** — lint was migrated to `@eslint-react/eslint-plugin` (`recommended-typescript` with compatibility-oriented overrides), `eslint` was upgraded to `10.2.1` and `@eslint/js` to `10.0.1`; `eslint-plugin-react` and `eslint-plugin-react-hooks` were removed, and the lint directive in `Portal.tsx` was updated to the new plugin rule namespace.
- **A5 batch 3 completed (`vite-plugin-svgr` 5.x)** — `vite-plugin-svgr` was upgraded from `4.5.0` to `5.2.0`, keeping the current SVG icon contract (`ReactComponent` named export) and passing full validation (`pnpm lint`, `pnpm typecheck:renderer`, `pnpm build:renderer`, `cargo check --manifest-path src-tauri/Cargo.toml`).
- **Validation/release scripts were hardened to reduce accidental bypass** — `scripts/release.sh` and `scripts/release.ps1` now require explicit confirmation when `--skip-validate`/`-SkipValidate` is used (or `POMODOROZ_RELEASE_SKIP_VALIDATE_ACK=1` in non-interactive mode), and `scripts/validar-tudo.sh` and `scripts/validar-tudo.ps1` now include `cargo check --all-targets --all-features` in the Rust quality gate (with a dedicated log in `--log-full-cargo`/`-LogMode full-cargo` mode).
- **Tauri runtime consistency fixes after technical audit** — `onSelectAutoUpdatePolicy` in `Layout` no longer uses inverted condition logic for auto-update sync, redundant non-null connector checks were removed (`Layout`, `Updater`, `Control`, `CompactTaskDisplay`, `CounterContext`, `TaskTransferSection`), orphan utility exports (`isBrowser`, `isObjectEmpty`) were removed from the `utils` barrel, Rust `restart_app` now uses a non-misleading no-return signature, reset confirmation flows (timer and task grid) moved to an internal React modal (instead of `@tauri-apps/plugin-dialog`), and the legacy `runtimeInvokeConnector` layer was removed.
- **Reset confirmations are now standardized with in-app modal UI to avoid Linux/GTK duplication** — reset prompts now render through the app `Portal` with i18n-controlled title/message (pt/en/es/ja/zh), eliminating duplicated text behavior from native dialogs; in compact mode, the app temporarily expands the window when needed to avoid modal clipping and collapses again after close.
- **Release operations guide updated for explicit preflight bypass usage** — `docs/RELEASE_OPERATIONS.md` now documents `--skip-validate`/`-SkipValidate` as emergency-only and requires `POMODOROZ_RELEASE_SKIP_VALIDATE_ACK=1` in non-interactive runs.
- **`validar-tudo.ps1` Windows compatibility fixed for `:` interpolation** — `PKG_CONFIG_PATH` assignment moved from direct string interpolation to safe formatting (`"{0}:{1}" -f ...`), preventing PowerShell `ParserError` (`InvalidVariableReferenceWithDrive`).
- **Windows quick run no longer requires global `pnpm` in PATH** — `scripts/validar-tudo.ps1` removed the `Get-Command pnpm` gate and now validates/runs package commands only through `scripts/pnpmw.mjs` (`node + corepack`), fixing the early failure in the interactive menu flow.
- **PowerShell `pnpmw/corepack` diagnostics improved** — `scripts/validar-tudo.ps1` now prints real details when `node scripts/pnpmw.mjs --version` fails and no longer hard-fails on false negatives when the command succeeds without a version line in stdout.
- **`pnpmw.mjs` no longer masks command failures as “pnpm not found”** — the wrapper now propagates the exit code of the first runnable candidate (for example, real `pnpm exec eslint` failures) and only falls back when the binary is truly unavailable (`ENOENT`).
- **Quick run no-install flow is now explicit with early dependency guard** — `scripts/validar-tudo.ps1` and `scripts/validar-tudo.sh` now label option 1 as no-install and fail fast with a direct message when `node_modules` is missing under `--skip-install`.
- **PowerShell version/release scripts are now resilient on Windows without global `pnpm`** — `scripts/version.ps1` and `scripts/release.ps1` now run package-manager commands through `node scripts/pnpmw.mjs`, removing hard dependency on a global `pnpm` binary in `PATH` and aligning behavior with wrappers already used by `validar-tudo.ps1` and `check-updates.ps1`.
- **`uninstall.ps1` now supports Windows user-scope with mode parity** — the script now runs on Linux and Windows with the same standard + `-Purge`/`-Yes` flow; on Windows it removes common user install folders (`%LOCALAPPDATA%`), Start Menu/Desktop shortcuts, and, with `-Purge`, clears local data in `%APPDATA%`/`%LOCALAPPDATA%` for both `pomodoroz` and `com.cjdduarte.pomodoroz`.
- **Windows release/installer build is now resilient to local executable locks** — `scripts/validar-tudo.ps1` now automatically terminates running instances of `src-tauri/target/release/pomodoroz_tauri.exe` before `tauri build`, avoiding `Access denied (os error 5)` when replacing the release binary.
- **Local installer generation no longer requires updater private signing key** — `scripts/validar-tudo.sh` and `scripts/validar-tudo.ps1` now force `bundle.createUpdaterArtifacts=false` for all local installer bundles, avoiding failure when `TAURI_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY` is not set outside the official signed-release pipeline.
- **PowerShell local Tauri config override is now Windows JSON-parse safe** — `scripts/validar-tudo.ps1` now uses a temporary file (`src-tauri/.tauri-local-no-updater.json`) with `--config` during installer generation, avoiding inline quoting parse errors (`key must be a string`) in `tauri build`.

## [26.4.28] - 2026-04-20

### Changed

- **Linux release pipeline pinned to a deterministic environment (no dependency fallback)** — `release-linux` now runs on `ubuntu-24.04` with explicit `libfuse2t64` installation for AppImage (`linuxdeploy`) packaging, removing conditional package-selection logic.
- **Linux AppImage pipeline hardened with explicit `linuxdeploy` gtk/gstreamer dependencies** — the release job now installs runtime/tooling GStreamer packages and `binutils`, with per-attempt logs and filtered tails for failure diagnostics without output flooding.
- **AppImage packaging aligned with freedesktop `.desktop` validation** — Linux category is now pinned to `Utility` (`tauri.conf.json`, bundle desktop template, and install scripts), removing `Productivity` as a non-registered category in `appimagetool`.
- **`sync-latest-json` aligned with `createUpdaterArtifacts: "v1Compatible"`** — platform merge now recognizes compressed updater artifacts (`.exe.zip` and `.AppImage.tar.gz`, with fallback to `.exe`/`.AppImage`) and release uploads now include those formats.

## [26.4.27] - 2026-04-20

### Changed

- **Runtime consolidated as Tauri-only** — dual-runtime/browser branches were removed from `runtimeInvokeConnector`, `ConnectorContext`, and `Updater` action flow.
- **Native utilities aligned to a single runtime** — `openExternalUrl` and `desktopNotification` now follow the Tauri-only path; `notificationAudio` keeps renderer-audio fallback only when native playback fails.
- **Development bootstrap simplified** — `dev:renderer` script was removed from `package.json`; Tauri `beforeDevCommand` now runs Vite directly.
- **Tauri titlebar drag path consolidated to a single strategy** — legacy `-webkit-app-region` rules were removed from `titlebar.ts`, keeping drag behavior via `data-tauri-drag-region` and `start_window_drag`.
- **Linux taskbar icon alignment between launcher and active window** — renderer `favicon.ico` was updated to the official app icon, and `.desktop` entries (local install + `deb/rpm` bundles) now declare `StartupWMClass/X-GNOME-WMClass` to reduce duplicate/switching panel icons.
- **`check-updates` wording aligned to root-only scope** — Shell/PowerShell labels were normalized (`Workspace` -> `Escopo`, `Monorepo/Tooling` -> `Tooling`) without changing update logic.
- **GitHub Release notes are now auto-populated from changelog again** — `release-autoupdate.yml` now extracts the target version section from `CHANGELOG.md` and applies it through `gh release create/edit`, preventing empty release bodies on tag/dispatch publish paths.
- **Documentation consolidated into a single improvements roadmap** — `docs/IMPROVEMENTS.md` is now the pending-work reference (technical + product), while `docs/MIGRATION_TO_TAURI.md` and `docs/PRODUCT_BACKLOG.md` remain compatibility pointers.

## [26.4.26] - 2026-04-19

### Changed

- **Tauri release pipeline hardened against transient AppImage network failures** — the Linux job in `.github/workflows/release-autoupdate.yml` now retries `pnpm tauri build --bundles appimage` up to 3 times before failing.
- **CI/release runtime improved with Rust build caching** — `Swatinem/rust-cache@v2` was added to `ci.yml` (`tauri-rust-check`) and to both Windows/Linux jobs in `release-autoupdate.yml`.
- **Legacy Electron/runtime residues cleaned from current operations** — removed the local `dist/linux-unpacked` artifact (not versioned), removed `-webkit-app-region` titlebar CSS rules, and dropped the unused global `window.isUserHaveSession` extension.
- **Install documentation aligned with published release scope** — `README.md` and `README.pt-BR.md` now state that published release artifacts currently target Windows/Linux, while macOS remains source-build based.
- **Legacy `styled-components/macro` usage removed from the renderer** — imports were migrated to `styled-components` across `src/`, the compatibility alias was removed from `app/renderer/vite.config.ts`, and `src/types/styled-components-macro.d.ts` was deleted.
- **“Native Titlebar” toggle hardened to prevent `X` button click loss after repeated switches** — `titlebar.ts` now explicitly marks drag region (`drag`) and window controls (`no-drag`) again, and Rust `set_native_titlebar` now performs a defensive surface renegotiation on Linux after `set_decorations`.

## [26.4.25] - 2026-04-18

### Fixed

- **Window dragging restored when disabling “Native Titlebar” on Tauri runtime** — the custom `Titlebar` now triggers native window drag (`start_window_drag`) on title-area `mousedown`, in addition to `data-tauri-drag-region`, while keeping window action buttons clickable outside that region.
- **Immediate border/shadow refresh when toggling native titlebar** — `ThemeContext` no longer uses a static `useNativeTitlebar` reference, preventing stale visual state after the toggle.

## [26.4.24] - 2026-04-17

### Changed

- **Legacy Electron packaging manifest removed from the repository without breaking build/release** — committed `app/electron/package.json` was removed, and a new `scripts/electron-builder-wrapper.mjs` now creates/removes an ephemeral manifest during `electron-builder` executions (local scripts and release workflow), keeping compatibility with electron-builder two-package expectations.
- **Electron packaging flow centralized in the root wrapper** — root `package.json` (`eb`) and `.github/workflows/release-autoupdate.yml` now run the dedicated wrapper (instead of calling `electron-builder` directly), preserving `traversal` dependency collection and removing operational coupling to a permanent `package.json` inside `app/electron`.
- **Phase 3b marked as completed in the migration plan** — `docs/MIGRATION_ELECTRON_TO_TAURI.md` was updated to reflect flatten-stage closure with removal of remaining workspace manifests and gate unblocked to start Phase 4 (Tauri CI).
- **Final hardening for Phase 2f (Tauri updater) completed** — `TauriInvokeConnector` now runs `downloadAndInstall` on `INSTALL_UPDATE` and restarts the app through a Rust `restart_app` command; the `In-app auto update` toggle is re-enabled for Tauri runtime, and the update screen now exposes a native “Install and restart” action with release-page fallback.
- **Phase 4 kickoff with PR/push CI gate** — new workflow `.github/workflows/ci.yml` adds automated `pnpm lint`, `pnpm typecheck:renderer`, `pnpm build:renderer`, and Linux `cargo check`, establishing a quality gate while release migration to a full Tauri-native pipeline is still in progress.
- **Tauri updater release workflow now supports tag-triggered runs (`v*`) in addition to manual dispatch** — `.github/workflows/release-tauri-updater.yml` now resolves `RELEASE_TAG` automatically on tag pushes, enabling signed updater asset publishing (`.exe`/`.AppImage` + `.sig` + `latest.json`) without relying only on `workflow_dispatch`.

## [26.4.23] - 2026-04-17

### Changed

- **Agent release procedure rule reinforced in documentation** — `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and `docs/RELEASE_OPERATIONS.md` now require the agent to fill the target version date (`YYYY-MM-DD`) in both `CHANGELOG.md` and `CHANGELOG.en.md` headers before suggesting `./scripts/release.sh`/`./scripts/release.ps1`.

## [26.4.22] - 2026-04-17

### Changed

- **`electron-builder` metadata migrated to a root-managed layout** — new root-level `electron-builder.config.json` is now the single source of truth for Electron packaging; the root `eb` script now uses this config explicitly, and `app/electron/package.json` no longer carries an embedded `build` block, preparing safe removal of the Electron packaging manifest in the final Phase 3b step.

## [26.4.21] - 2026-04-17

### Fixed

- **Electron installer publishing in GitHub Actions now uses a valid package-manager context again** — the root `eb` script (`package.json`) no longer forces `npm_execpath=traversal`/`npm_config_user_agent=traversal`; as a result, `release-autoupdate` jobs can run `pnpm eb ... --publish always` without `spawn traversal ENOENT` on Windows and Linux.

## [26.4.20] - 2026-04-17

### Fixed

- **Release workflow installer builds (Windows/Linux) work again on CI** — `app/electron/package.json` no longer injects `npm_config_user_agent=traversal npm_execpath=traversal` into the `eb` script; in recent `electron-builder` versions those envs caused the packager to literally spawn a `traversal` binary to install subproject dependencies, breaking `pnpm eb --win nsis` and `pnpm eb --linux AppImage` with `spawn traversal ENOENT`.
- **Release scripts now stage `src-tauri/Cargo.lock`** — `scripts/release.sh` and `scripts/release.ps1` now include `src-tauri/Cargo.lock` in the release commit; Cargo regenerates the lockfile with the new version during preflight (fmt/clippy), so without staging it the file stayed permanently marked as modified after each release.

## [26.4.19] - 2026-04-17

### Changed

- **AppImage generation in `validar-tudo` (Tauri runtime) is now mandatory and Linux-resilient** — `scripts/validar-tudo.sh` and `scripts/validar-tudo.ps1` now run AppImage builds with `NO_STRIP=1` + `APPIMAGE_EXTRACT_AND_RUN=1`, apply an automatic `pkg-config` workaround when `gdk-pixbuf` resolves to a missing path, and no longer downgrade AppImage failures to silent warnings in installer flow.
- **Local AppImage installer flow now disables signed updater artifact generation** — in `validar-tudo*`, local AppImage build now uses `bundle.createUpdaterArtifacts=false` to avoid failures when `TAURI_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY` is not set outside the official release pipeline.
- **Operational flow is now root-driven (without `pnpm-workspace.yaml`)** — day-to-day `dev/build/lint` now runs directly from root scripts (`build:renderer`, `build:electron`, `typecheck:renderer`, `dev:app` via `scripts/dev-app.mjs`), `app/renderer/package.json` was removed, and wrappers (`validar-tudo*`, `install*`, `check-updates*`, `release-autoupdate.yml`) no longer depend on workspace `pnpm --filter` calls.
- **`version-sync`/`release` are now resilient to optional manifest flattening** — `scripts/version-sync.mjs` now treats `app/electron/package.json` and `app/renderer/package.json` as optional (while keeping root `package.json` + Tauri files required), and `scripts/release.sh`/`scripts/release.ps1` now build `git add` inputs dynamically so release flow does not break when those manifests are removed.
- **Root scripts no longer depend on `lerna run` for daily operations** — `package.json` now uses `scripts/pnpmw.mjs` with `pnpm -r --filter` for `dev:*`, `build*`, `release*`, and `clean`, starting the Phase 3b kickoff (progressively removing Lerna/Nx coupling while keeping the current `app/*` structure for now).
- **Remaining Lerna/Nx orchestration leftovers removed from the repository** — `lerna.json` was removed, root `package.json` dropped the `lerna` script/dependency, and `pnpm-workspace.yaml` no longer carries the `nx` toggle, keeping daily builds on pure `pnpm`; `check-updates` tooling inventory no longer reports `lerna`.
- **Renderer flatten kickoff completed with root-level `src`** — frontend source was moved from `app/renderer/src` to `src`, and `app/renderer/index.html`, `app/renderer/tsconfig.json`, `app/renderer/vite.config.ts`, and `app/renderer/package.json` scripts (lint/prebuild) were updated to keep `pnpm lint` and `pnpm build` green during the transition.
- **Renderer dependency source consolidated into the root manifest** — duplicated entries between root `package.json` and `app/renderer/package.json` were removed from the renderer workspace (keeping only renderer-local specifics), and `check-updates.sh/.ps1` now reads the `[Renderer]` inventory directly from the root (`root/src`) manifest during the flat-structure transition.
- **Operational flow decoupled from `@pomodoroz/shareables`** — `app/electron` now uses a local IPC contract (`app/electron/src/ipc.ts`), the `workspace:*` dependency was removed from `app/electron/package.json`, and scripts/workflow (`validar-tudo*`, `install*`, `check-updates*`, `release-autoupdate.yml`) no longer run build/lint steps scanning the `app/shareables` workspace.
- **Legacy `app/shareables` workspace removed from the monorepo** — package files were deleted, `package.json`/`pnpm-workspace.yaml` now list only `app/electron` and `app/renderer`, and the lockfile was regenerated without local link references to `@pomodoroz/shareables`.
- **`pnpm` orchestration switched to path-based filters (instead of workspace names)** — root scripts (`package.json`), validation wrappers (`validar-tudo.sh/.ps1`), Tauri bootstrap (`src-tauri/tauri.conf.json`), and release workflow (`release-autoupdate.yml`) now target `./app/renderer` and `./app/electron`, reducing coupling to workspace names (`@pomodoroz/renderer`/`pomodoroz`) during the final flatten stage.

## [26.4.18] - 2026-04-16

### Changed

- **Release workflow `pnpm` bootstrap fixed to avoid Actions failure (`pnpm` not found)** — `.github/workflows/release-autoupdate.yml` no longer uses `pnpm` cache in `actions/setup-node`, keeping `pnpm` activation via Corepack before build/publish commands.
- **Tauri flow and contributor docs aligned to `pnpm`** — `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json` now uses `scripts/pnpmw.mjs` for `beforeDevCommand`/`beforeBuildCommand` (removing Yarn dependency from Tauri runtime bootstrap), and `README*`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and `docs/MIGRATION_ELECTRON_TO_TAURI.md` were updated to `pnpm`-based commands/requirements.
- **Phase 2f kickoff wired for Tauri updater in safe notify-only mode** — initial `tauri-plugin-updater` integration was added in `src-tauri` plus `@tauri-apps/plugin-updater` in renderer, with policy bridge (`SET_IN_APP_AUTO_UPDATE`) through `TauriConnector` and `UPDATE_AVAILABLE` propagation to the existing UI flow. Install/restart (`downloadAndInstall` + relaunch strategy) remains pending for final signed-feed hardening of the Tauri release pipeline.
- **Tauri updater now uses real public key + compatible updater artifacts (`latest.json`)** — `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json` now has `plugins.updater.pubkey` configured and `bundle.createUpdaterArtifacts: "v1Compatible"`, preparing signed feed generation for the configured update endpoint.
- **Manual workflow to publish signed Tauri updater assets added** — `.github/workflows/release-tauri-updater.yml` builds/uploads updater artifacts (Windows NSIS and Linux AppImage + `.sig` + `latest*.json`) to a specific tag using `TAURI_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY` and `TAURI_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY_PASSWORD`.
- **`version-sync` and release scripts now include Tauri runtime version files** — `scripts/version-sync.mjs` now synchronizes `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json` and `src-tauri/Cargo.toml`; `scripts/release.sh`/`scripts/release.ps1` now stage those files in release commits to avoid Electron/Tauri version drift.
- **Release now requires final date in both changelogs** — `scripts/release.sh` and `scripts/release.ps1` now validate `CHANGELOG.md` and `CHANGELOG.en.md` headings as `## [x.y.z] - YYYY-MM-DD` for the target version (blocking `A definir`/`TBD` and also blocking PT/EN date mismatch).

## [26.4.17] - 2026-04-16

### Changed

- **GitHub Actions release workflow standardized across Linux/Windows with Corepack-based `pnpm` pinning** — `.github/workflows/release-autoupdate.yml` now activates `pnpm` using `corepack prepare pnpm@10.33.0 --activate` in both release jobs, removing reliance on `pnpm/action-setup@v4` and Node 20 deprecation warnings.
- **`check-updates` improved for workflow pin guidance and cleaner Cargo output in shell/PowerShell** — `scripts/check-updates.sh` and `scripts/check-updates.ps1` now show `pnpm` workflow pin status/suggestions (supporting both `pnpm/action-setup` and `corepack` formats), clearly state that `report` mode does not apply JS/TS updates, keep Cargo output compact (`root-deps-only` + advisory summary), and write full `cargo outdated`/`cargo audit` details to `logs/` in interactive mode. A fallback `pnpm` update hint via `npm install -g` was also added for environments without `corepack` in PATH, plus an initial log-type menu (`none`, `cargo`, `full`) when running with no arguments.
- **`check-updates` now includes JS-style Rust selection for root crates (`SAFE`/`MAJOR`)** — in interactive mode, when `cargo outdated --root-deps-only` reports updates, `scripts/check-updates.sh` and `scripts/check-updates.ps1` now let you select Rust updates by category and confirm before applying `cargo update -p <crate> --precise <version>`.
- **`validar-tudo` now includes a log-type menu and split Rust gate traces** — when run interactively with no arguments, `scripts/validar-tudo.sh` and `scripts/validar-tudo.ps1` now prompt for log mode (`none`, `full`, `full-cargo`); under `full-cargo`, `cargo fmt` and `cargo clippy` are also written to dedicated files in `logs/`.

## [26.4.16] - 2026-04-16

### Added

- **Initial Tauri runtime scaffold (v2)** — new `src-tauri/` directory with `Cargo.toml`, `build.rs`, `src/main.rs`, `src/lib.rs`, capabilities, and default icons to bootstrap a dual-runtime flow.
- **Tauri tooling in the current monorepo** — added `@tauri-apps/cli` and `@tauri-apps/api` dependencies at the root project plus a new `yarn tauri` script.

### Changed

- **Tauri config aligned with current renderer workspace** — `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json` now targets `../app/renderer/build`, uses `devUrl` `http://localhost:3000`, and runs renderer workspace commands in `beforeDevCommand`/`beforeBuildCommand`.
- **Initial Tauri app metadata adjusted** — identifier set to `com.cjdduarte.pomodoroz`, scaffold version set to `26.4.15`, and initial window size set to `340x470` to better match current Electron behavior.
- **Renderer native calls centralized behind connector APIs** — direct `window.electron` usage was removed from `CounterContext`, `Control`, and `TaskTransferSection`; these flows now use the typed `InvokeConnector` contract.
- **Connector contract expanded for Phase 1** — `InvokeConnector` now includes `send`, `receive`, and `invoke`, preserving Electron behavior while preparing the Tauri swap.
- **`TauriConnector` runtime path enabled** — `ConnectorContext` now selects provider by runtime (`electron`/`tauri`), with a dedicated `TauriInvokeConnector` for window/fullscreen/compact mode and task import/export flow under Tauri.
- **Tauri capability permissions aligned** — `src-tauri/capabilities/default.json` now includes explicit window permissions required by the connector (`show`, `hide`, `close`, `minimize`, `set_focus`, `set_always_on_top`, `set_fullscreen`, `set_size`, `set_theme`, `set_decorations`).
- **Compact mode detached from direct Electron usage** — `CompactTaskDisplay` now uses `getInvokeConnector()` for `COMPACT_EXPAND`/`COMPACT_COLLAPSE`.
- **Rust command bridge started in `src-tauri`** — added native commands in `src-tauri/src/commands/window_bridge.rs` (always-on-top, fullscreen break, compact mode, theme, titlebar, show/minimize/close), and `TauriInvokeConnector` now calls these channels via `invoke()`.
- **Renderer decoupled from `@pomodoroz/shareables`** — frontend IPC contract moved to `app/renderer/src/ipc/index.ts`, renderer imports now use `ipc`, and the package dependency was removed from `@pomodoroz/renderer`.
- **Tauri reset confirmation flow refined for clarity** — `TauriInvokeConnector` replaced `window.prompt` with a two-step `window.confirm` flow, preserving `cancel/no/yes` decisions without a text input field.
- **Fullscreen break exit via `Esc` restored on Tauri** — `CounterContext` now exits fullscreen by keyboard during break, matching expected behavior from the previous experience.
- **Initial tray support enabled in Tauri runtime (Phase 2a)** — `src-tauri/src/lib.rs` now creates a tray icon with menu actions (`Restore`/`Quit`) and left-click restore behavior.
- **Close/minimize-to-tray behavior re-enabled with safe fallback** — `window_bridge` now hides the window only when tray is available; otherwise it performs normal minimize/close to avoid hidden-window dead ends.
- **Native titlebar `X` now honors `Close to tray` on Tauri** — Rust backend now intercepts main-window `CloseRequested` using `set_tray_behavior` state, avoiding inconsistent close behavior after tray restore.
- **Hide-vs-exit decision now centralized in the native close flow** — `close_window` now delegates to `window.close()`, and `CloseRequested` (backed by `TrayBehaviorState`) is the single decision point for hide vs exit.
- **Custom titlebar `X` now honors `Close to tray` consistently** — the React titlebar now routes through the same native `CloseRequested` path used by normal window close.
- **Dynamic tray icon now works on Tauri** — `TRAY_ICON_UPDATE` now converts renderer `dataUrl` into bytes and updates the native tray icon through the Rust `set_tray_icon` command, removing no-op overhead.
- **Tray menu now syncs with app language on Tauri** — tray labels (`Restore`/`Quit`, etc.) are now updated from renderer via `SET_TRAY_COPY`, avoiding English-only tray text when UI is Portuguese.
- **`SET_TRAY_BEHAVIOR` re-enabled on Tauri path** — renderer now syncs `closeToTray` to native state so hide-vs-exit behavior has a single source of truth.
- **`Open at login` re-enabled on Tauri runtime (Phase 2g kickoff)** — initial `tauri-plugin-autostart` wiring now connects the Settings toggle to native backend behavior through `SET_OPEN_AT_LOGIN` in `TauriConnector`.
- **Single-instance behavior restored on Tauri runtime (Electron parity)** — `tauri-plugin-single-instance` is now wired so repeated launcher/start-menu opens focus/restore the existing window instead of spawning duplicate app instances.
- **NSIS Start Menu shortcut path made explicit** — `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json` now sets `bundle.windows.nsis.startMenuFolder = \"Pomodoroz\"` for more predictable Start Menu discoverability on Windows.
- **Task import/export on Tauri moved to native dialogs (Phase 2h kickoff)** — `TauriInvokeConnector` now uses `tauri-plugin-dialog` (`save/open`) plus Rust bridge commands (`write_text_file`/`read_text_file`), removing the previous web fallback based on `<a download>` and `<input type=\"file\">`.
- **Notification sound on Tauri moved to native Rust playback (Phase 2i kickoff)** — renderer now sends WAV bytes to Rust command `play_notification_sound` (using `rodio`), with renderer fallback kept for non-Tauri runtimes or native-audio failures.
- **First-run update-policy prompt layout refined** — title/body are now centered in the modal, and action labels now use compact wording to avoid visual overflow on narrow windows.
- **Updater guardrail kept on Tauri after 2f defer decision** — only `In-app auto update` remains disabled in Settings until final release-hardening implementation.
- **Tauri stack versions pinned to reduce ecosystem drift** — `@tauri-apps/api`, `@tauri-apps/cli`, `tauri`, `tauri-build`, and `tauri-plugin-log` now use fixed versions in the project.
- **Linux tray icon cache collisions mitigated across dev sessions** — `setup_tray` now uses an app-specific per-session (`pid+timestamp`) `temp_dir_path` under runtime temp storage and performs defensive cleanup of orphan session folders, reducing stale icon-path reuse between `yarn tauri dev` runs.
- **Renderer desktop notifications migrated to a cross-runtime wrapper** — `useNotification` and `Updater` now call `showDesktopNotification`, which uses `tauri-plugin-notification` on Tauri and keeps browser notification fallback outside Tauri.
- **Tauri notification capability enabled in app permissions** — `src-tauri/capabilities/default.json` now includes `notification:default`, unblocking `isPermissionGranted`/`requestPermission`/`notify` on native runtime.
- **External link opening on Tauri fixed through native opener path** — support/help links and release-note opening no longer rely on `window.open`/`target=\"_blank\"`; they now use `plugin-opener` (`@tauri-apps/plugin-opener` + `tauri-plugin-opener`).
- **Notification permission request moved to user-gesture flow** — permission prompting was moved out of async timer events into Settings interaction (notification type selection), avoiding WebKit/Tauri prompt rejection (`Notification prompting can only be done from a user gesture`).
- **Initial global shortcuts migrated to Tauri (Phase 2c kickoff)** — Rust backend now registers `Alt+Shift+H` (hide app; fallback to minimize when tray is unavailable) and `Alt+Shift+S` (restore/focus window), matching Electron behavior.
- **`version/release/check-updates` scripts migrated to `pnpm` with no fallback** — `.sh`/`.ps1` pairs now require `pnpm`, use `pnpm version:sync` for version/release flows, and run updates via `pnpm outdated --format json` + `pnpm add`.
- **`check-updates` now includes a Rust (Cargo) report step** — `.sh`/`.ps1` scripts now run a `[5/5]` block with `cargo outdated` and `cargo audit` (when installed) and show recommended manual crate-update commands.
- **`validar-tudo` now enforces Rust quality gates for `src-tauri`** — default preflight now includes `cargo fmt --all -- --check` and `cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings` (while keeping `quick-dev` fast without Rust gates).
- **Local install scripts migrated to `pnpm` with no fallback** — `scripts/install.sh` and `scripts/install.ps1` now require `pnpm` and run pre-check/build/AppImage steps through `pnpm` (`pnpm --filter ... run ...`, `pnpm build:dir`, `pnpm exec electron-builder`).
- **`validar-tudo` wrappers migrated to `pnpm` with no fallback** — `.sh`/`.ps1` scripts now validate `pnpm`, run lint/typecheck/build through `pnpm`, and execute packaged/installer flows via `pnpm exec electron-builder`.
- **PowerShell script compatibility fixed for Windows PowerShell 5.1** — `validar-tudo.ps1` and `check-updates.ps1` were updated to avoid parser-breaking interpolation patterns (notably variable+`:` and `&&` in problematic command examples), fixing `-File` execution errors.
- **PowerShell scripts now route `pnpm` through `pnpmw`/Corepack** — `validar-tudo.ps1` and `check-updates.ps1` now call `node scripts/pnpmw.mjs` for pnpm operations, preventing `pnpm not found` failures when the binary is missing from `PATH` on Windows.
- **`check-updates.sh` JS/TS table alignment fixed** — `pnpm outdated` JSON parsing now keeps columns aligned when `workspace` is empty, so package names are shown correctly again.
- **Root/workspace `package.json` scripts migrated to `pnpm`** — build/lint/start/release commands in `package.json`, `app/electron/package.json`, `app/renderer/package.json`, and `app/shareables/package.json` no longer call `yarn`, removing implicit fallback in prebuild/build flows.
- **`pnpm` script execution made resilient when binary is missing from PATH** — new wrapper `scripts/pnpmw.mjs` is now used by root/workspace `package.json` scripts to run `pnpm` directly when available or `corepack pnpm` when needed, fixing Windows failures such as `'pnpm' is not recognized` during `corepack pnpm run ...` flows.
- **`pnpmw` on Windows now invokes `corepack.js` directly from the Node installation directory** — the wrapper now resolves `node_modules/corepack/dist/corepack.js` next to `node.exe`, so `pnpm` works even when `corepack.cmd` resolution fails in child-process PATH lookup.
- **`pnpmw` is now resilient to invalid `npm_execpath` in profile-less shells** — the wrapper now only accepts candidates whose probe exits with `status=0` and no longer aborts early when `npm_execpath` fails, preventing `validar-tudo.ps1` startup failure under `powershell -NoProfile`.
- **`pnpmw` on Windows now iterates candidates without aborting on first runtime failure** — when an available candidate fails to execute (for example `corepack.cmd` in specific shell contexts), the wrapper proceeds to the next candidates and also tries `cmd.exe` invocation, reducing false `pnpm not found` outcomes.
- **`lerna run` execution stabilized for Corepack-only Windows environments** — `lerna.json` now uses `npmClient: \"npm\"` to avoid `'pnpm' is not recognized` failures in child processes, while dependency management remains on `pnpm` and scripts keep using `pnpmw`.
- **`validar-tudo.ps1` fixed for strict Clippy gate on Windows** — Rust validation now enforces `-D warnings` through `RUSTFLAGS`, avoiding argument forwarding/parsing failures in environments where `cargo clippy -- -D warnings` is not accepted as expected.
- **`validar-tudo.ps1` packaging path hardened for Windows without `pnpm` in PATH** — the script now invokes `electron-builder` through the Electron workspace `eb` script (which sets traversal env vars), avoiding node-module-collector failure with `'pnpm' is not recognized`.
- **`check-updates.ps1` fixed to preserve real `pnpmw` output** — the `pnpm` function no longer discards stdout/stderr, restoring proper `pnpm` version detection and `pnpm outdated --format json` parsing.
- **`check-updates.ps1` updated for PowerShell 5.1 list-to-array conversion** — update rows now use `ToArray()` instead of array-subexpression over `List[object]`, eliminating `Argument types do not match` during per-workspace reports.
- **`check-updates.ps1` `pnpm outdated` parser hardened for keyed-object payloads** — the script now correctly handles JSON returned as `PSCustomObject` with package names as keys, restoring JS/TS update rows on Windows PowerShell 5.1.
- **Local operational logs excluded from Git tracking** — `.gitignore` now includes `/logs/`, avoiding runtime-noise files (`validar-tudo`, `check-updates`, `cargo audit/outdated`) in `git status`.
- **Pre-commit hook aligned with `pnpm` workflow** — `.husky/pre-commit` no longer calls `yarn lint-staged` and now uses `node ./scripts/pnpmw.mjs exec lint-staged`, preventing commit failures in environments without Yarn.
- **SAFE dependency batch applied with full validation** — `@types/node` (`25.5.2 -> 25.6.0`) in root and renderer, `react-router` (`7.14.0 -> 7.14.1`) in renderer, `electron` (`41.2.0 -> 41.2.1`) in Electron workspace, and `tauri-plugin-global-shortcut` (`2.2.1 -> 2.3.1`) in `src-tauri`.
- **`validar-tudo` now auto-repairs Electron runtime for `dev:app` flow** — `scripts/validar-tudo.sh` and `scripts/validar-tudo.ps1` now check `require('electron')` before starting dev mode and, when the binary is missing/incomplete, automatically run Electron package `install.js` in `app/electron`.
- **Primary auto-update prompt label shortened for PT-BR/EN/ES** — `settings.autoUpdatePromptEnable` now uses `Atualizar auto.` (pt), `Auto update` (en), and `Actualizar auto.` (es) to avoid visual overflow on narrow windows.
- **`uninstall` purge mode now covers Tauri runtime data on Linux** — `scripts/uninstall.sh` and `scripts/uninstall.ps1` now also remove identifier-based paths (`~/.config/com.cjdduarte.pomodoroz`, `~/.cache/com.cjdduarte.pomodoroz`, and `~/.local/share/com.cjdduarte.pomodoroz`) in addition to legacy `~/.config/pomodoroz` and `~/.cache/pomodoroz`.

### Documentation

- **Tauri migration plan (Phase 0) refined** — scope updated for a Yarn-based dual runtime, `tauri` script in root `package.json`, and integration via `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json` with the current renderer workspace, without premature folder restructuring.
- **Commit/PR language policy formalized** — `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and `CONTRIBUTING.md` now explicitly require commit messages and PR titles in English (Conventional Commits).
- **Milestone-based execution tracking added to migration plan** — `docs/MIGRATION_ELECTRON_TO_TAURI.md` now includes an explicit phase tracker (status, advancement gate, and execution checklists for phases 0 and 1).
- **Migration tracker advanced to 2c after manual 2b closure** — `docs/MIGRATION_ELECTRON_TO_TAURI.md` now records notification parity validation (user-gesture permission prompt + notification delivery) as completed.
- **Tracker advanced to 2d after Linux manual 2c validation** — `docs/MIGRATION_ELECTRON_TO_TAURI.md` now marks `Alt+Shift+H/S` global shortcut parity as validated on Linux dev runtime and opens the 2d operational snapshot.
- **Phase 2 Linux operational snapshot updated in migration plan** — `docs/MIGRATION_ELECTRON_TO_TAURI.md` now records revalidation of `validar-tudo` flows (options 5 and 6) and `uninstall` `purge`, including non-blocking `linux-unpacked` diagnostics.
- **Phase 3a checklist updated for lockfile and release workflow migration** — `docs/MIGRATION_ELECTRON_TO_TAURI.md` now marks `yarn.lock` removal and `.github/workflows/release-autoupdate.yml` migration to `pnpm` as completed, keeping only the GitHub Actions runtime validation pending.
- **Release operations guide aligned with current flow (`pnpm` + `release.sh`)** — `docs/RELEASE_OPERATIONS.md` now reflects real tagging/publishing commands and explicitly documents keeping `A definir`/`TBD` until release day, setting the final date only at publication time.

### Note

- Release `26.4.16` still publishes Electron artifacts (`NSIS .exe` + `.AppImage` + `latest*.yml`). Tauri items above are internal migration progress (dual runtime), without switching the official release pipeline in this version.

## [26.4.15] - 2026-04-09

### Fixed

- **Grid color reset now acts on first click** — button now shows immediate confirmation and applies reset without requiring a second click.
- **Grid reset confirmation copy updated** — confirmation message now uses an interrogative dialog style (`window.confirm`) across pt/en/es/ja/zh.

## [26.4.14] - 2026-04-09

### Fixed

- **PT-BR support wording normalized.**
- **Cross-list drag visual stabilized** — when dragging a task to another list, the card no longer visually snaps back to the source list before drop.
- **Drag preview aligned with real card UI** — drag overlay now reuses the same card styling (width, layout, and icons), improving visual consistency while moving tasks.
- **Top list icons visually separated** — list drag button now uses a grip icon, reducing visual ambiguity with the actions menu (`...`) button.
- **SVG typing aligned for TypeScript 6** — `*.svg` module now declares named `ReactComponent` in `src/typings.d.ts`, removing `TS2614` in the icons index.
- **`useTargetOutside` hook aligned with React refs in TS6** — `ref` now accepts `RefObject<T | null>`, removing `TS2322` in `TaskHeader` and other `useRef(..., null)` call sites.
- **Renderer typecheck added to validation wrappers** — `scripts/validar-tudo.sh` and `scripts/validar-tudo.ps1` now run `yarn workspace @pomodoroz/renderer exec tsc --noEmit -p tsconfig.json` in both full and `quick-dev` flows.
- **Renderer TS6 typing cleanup batch** — fixed event handler typings (`implicit any`), button ref compatibility in ripple effect, `wakeLock` typing, `children` typing in `Dimmer`, ref compatibility in `Popper`, and widened `trackedTaskActionTypes` in tasks history reducer.

## [26.4.13] - 2026-04-08

### Fixed

- **Readable HTML release notes in Updater** — when `releaseNotes` arrives as HTML, the screen now normalizes it to structured text before rendering, avoiding raw tag output.
- **Escaped HTML release notes compatibility** — when notes arrive with escaped entities (`&lt;p&gt;...`), Updater now decodes them before normalization/rendering.
- **Settings support message updated** — one-time banner now mentions both support paths (⭐ GitHub and ☕ coffee), matching the footer action buttons.
- **First-run update prompt persistence fixed** — if the app is closed before choosing `Yes/No`, the prompt is shown again on next launch until the user makes an explicit choice.
- **Initial update check deferred until explicit choice** — on a fresh profile, main no longer runs `checkForUpdates()` at boot; the first check runs only after the user picks `Yes/No` in the policy prompt.
- **Release notes screen hidden in automatic mode** — when `In-app Auto Update` is enabled, Settings no longer forces the `Updater` screen; download/install flow stays on native notifications.
- **Local AppImage selection fixed in install scripts** — `scripts/install.sh` and `scripts/install.ps1` now pick the newest artifact by version (`sort -V`/`[version]`), avoiding old installs like `26.4.8` when `26.4.12` is already available.

### Changed

- **First-run update policy choice** — on a fresh profile (clean install/data), the app now shows a one-time prompt on first open to choose `in-app auto update` or `notify only`; the choice is persisted and can be changed later in Settings.

### Note

- This release includes updates across renderer/main (update flow) and Linux local install scripts (AppImage).

## [26.4.12] - 2026-04-08

### Fixed

- **Windows installer shortcut hardening (NSIS)** — `nsis` config now explicitly sets `shortcutName`, `createStartMenuShortcut`, and `createDesktopShortcut`.
- **Fallback for missing Start Menu shortcut** — new NSIS include (`electron-builder/installer.nsh`) recreates the shortcut when it is missing after install/update.
- **No redundant version in Windows "Installed apps" title** — NSIS `uninstallDisplayName` is now set to `Pomodoroz`, keeping version only in the details row.
- **Renderer Updater i18n** — update screen copy and release-page notification text now use `updater.*` keys in pt/en/es/ja/zh.

### Changed

- **Safe dependency updates** — `electron` (`41.1.1 -> 41.2.0`), `i18next` (`26.0.3 -> 26.0.4`), `@typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin` (`8.58.0 -> 8.58.1`), and `@typescript-eslint/parser` (`8.58.0 -> 8.58.1`).

### Note

- Change is limited to the Windows NSIS target; Linux/AppImage flow remains unchanged.

## [26.4.11] - 2026-04-08

### Changed

- **Configurable update policy in Settings** — new `In-app Auto Update` toggle; default mode is notify+redirect to release page, and enabling it restores in-app download/install behavior.
- **Updater IPC contract refined** — added `SET_IN_APP_AUTO_UPDATE` and `OPEN_RELEASE_PAGE`; `INSTALL_UPDATE` remains as a compatibility alias for one transition cycle.
- **Settings header now shows app version** — displays `vX.Y.Z` in a subtle way.
- **Downloaded-update guard now logs explicitly** — when an update finishes downloading with in-app mode disabled, main logs the decision and intentionally skips the install prompt.
- **Tag-based version suggestion** — `release/version` scripts (bash + PowerShell) now suggest `YY.M.(last+1)` from local `vYY.M.*` tags; when a month turns with no tags, they suggest `YY.M.1`.
- **Tag sync in release flow** — `release.sh`/`release.ps1` now attempt `fetch --tags` automatically; if network/auth fails, they continue with a warning and use local tags.
- **Release mode menu** — without parameters, `release.sh`/`release.ps1` now show an interactive menu to choose real release or simulation mode.

### Translations

- **New settings label key** — `settings.inAppAutoUpdate` added in pt/en/es/ja/zh.

### Manual test (release)

- **Default mode (toggle off)** — when an update is detected, the app only notifies and the button opens the release page in the browser.
- **In-app mode (toggle on)** — after update detection/download, the app shows the `Quit and Install` prompt.
- **Settings** — header displays the current app version as `vX.Y.Z`.

## [26.4.10] - 2026-04-08

### Fixed

- **Safer update installation trigger** — `quitAndInstall()` now runs only when the `"Quit and Install"` action is explicitly confirmed in the notification callback.
- **Updater listener registration order** — updater events (`update-available`, `download-progress`, `update-downloaded`) are now registered before `checkForUpdates()`, reducing race risk on fast responses.
- **Consistent update state typing** — renderer `updateBody` was normalized to `string`, with safe fallback for legacy persisted state.

### Changed

- **Release notes workflow hardening** — CI now fails with explicit error messages when `CHANGELOG.md` is missing the tagged version section or when that section is empty.
- **Script-based release flow** — added dedicated release scripts (`scripts/release.sh` and `scripts/release.ps1`) and root shortcuts (`release:tag*`) in `package.json`.

### Documentation

- **CHANGELOG <-> Release policy formalized** — changelog/tag/release-notes linkage is now explicitly documented in `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and `docs/TECHNICAL_DECISIONS_2026.md`.
- **Auto-update channel policy clarified** — current in-app support is explicitly scoped to Windows NSIS and Linux AppImage; portable/deb/rpm/AUR remain out of in-app auto-update scope.
- **Dependency visibility planning** — added planned task to evolve `check-updates.sh` with `report --full` coverage (dependencies + audit + GitHub Actions).

## [26.4.9] - 2026-04-07

### Changed

- **Fork auto-update activated in release flow** — publishing pipeline now generates and uploads update metadata to GitHub Releases for Windows (`latest.yml`) and Linux AppImage (`latest-linux.yml`).
- **Automated release workflow (CI)** — new dedicated workflow to publish platform update artifacts.

### Validated

- **Windows (NSIS)** — update detection from `26.4.8` to `26.4.9` confirmed.
- **Linux (AppImage)** — update artifacts and metadata published successfully.

## [26.4.8] - 2026-04-07

### Changed

- **Renderer build dependency** — `vite` updated from `8.0.6` to `8.0.7`.

### Note

- This release does not add new end-user features; it is a dependency maintenance update.

## [26.4.7] - 2026-04-07 (Initial Pomodoroz Release)

### Scope

- Consolidates all post-fork work through **2026-04-07** before first public release.
- Classification below is relative to the original **Pomatez v1.10.0** baseline.

### Added

- **Statistics module** — full report screen with focus/break/idle time tracking, completed cycles, daily flow chart, and per-task breakdown. Data 100% local.
- **Study Rotation Grid** — list/grid toggle in Tasks with per-card daily status (`white/green/red`) and persisted state.
- **Grid card actions** — right-click selection keeps Timer sync behavior (normal mode navigates to Timer; compact mode collapses after selection).
- **Compact Grid Expansion** — grid available in compact mode with resize/collapse IPC integration.
- **Draw button (`Sortear`)** — optional via Settings; phase-based draw (`white -> green`, then `green -> red`) without navigating to Timer.
- **Grid color-loop setting** — optional manual loop on card click (`red -> white`) controlled in Settings.
- **Grid columns control** — selector (`Auto / 1 / 2 / 3`) in toolbar with persisted preference across normal and compact modes.
- **Tasks import/export (JSON)** — Settings supports exporting/importing task lists/cards with schema validation, `version`, UUID regeneration, and merge/replace option.
- **Reset time to Idle (focus only)** — new Settings toggle (`Back may count as Idle`) with `Yes/No/Cancel` confirmation on reset.
- **Custom notification sound** — select between default bell or custom sound file in Settings.
- **0-minute breaks** — short/long break sliders allow 0 minutes (auto-skip break).
- **Compact task display** — expanded `CompactTaskDisplay` with actions menu (done/skip/delete) in all modes, replacing the old `PriorityCard`.
- **Native quit confirmation** — localized dialog in Electron main (pt/en).
- **Update IPC flow** — end-to-end `UPDATE_AVAILABLE` / `INSTALL_UPDATE` for fork-stage policy.
- **i18n** — translations for Statistics in pt, en, es, ja, zh.
- **Strict mode warning i18n** — localized Timer warning bubble text using `timer.strictModeNotice` in all locales.

- **Vite config migration (Rolldown)** — `rollupOptions` to `rolldownOptions` for Vite 8 compatibility.
- **Styled-components prop forwarding hardening** — `StyleSheetManager.shouldForwardProp` combining `@emotion/is-prop-valid` with project-specific blocked props.
- **Notarization package migration** — replaced deprecated `electron-notarize` with `@electron/notarize`.
- **Tasks textarea autosize migration** — now uses `react-textarea-autosize`.

- **React 19 ref-pattern alignment** — replaced `React.forwardRef` with ref-as-prop in `TaskDetails`, `Checkbox`, and `Radio`.
- **Timer footer actions (P2.5 G1)** — actions trigger now uses `option-x` icon; without active task, opens dropdown directly.
- **Post-break switch flow (P2.5 G2)** — "Switch" in post-break prompt now opens the rotation grid.
- **Tasks list right-click parity (P2.5 G3)** — list mode now mirrors grid behavior.
- **Grouped Grid mode (P2.5 G4)** — `Group/Ungroup` toggle with persisted preference and flat full-width list separators.
- **Grid toolbar icon affordance (P2.5 G4)** — `Reset`, `Draw`, and `Group/Ungroup` use icon-only controls with localized tooltips.
- **Grouped card density refinement** — grouped mode renders shorter cards.
- **Tasks list priority action refinement** — clicking `Priority List` also selects the first pending card.
- **Rebranding** — renamed from Pomatez to Pomodoroz (`com.cjdduarte.pomodoroz`).

### Fixed

- **Tray behavior consistency** — main process now keeps in-memory tray behavior state synchronized via `SET_TRAY_BEHAVIOR`.
- **Fullscreen break state restoration** — fullscreen cycle now restores previous window state.
- **Fullscreen visual/native synchronization + Wayland robustness** — fullscreen UI applies only after native confirmation, with Linux/Wayland fallback.
- **Timer display** — clamped to zero (no more negative `0-1 : 0-1`).
- **SVG progress ring** — protected against division by zero.
- **Countdown interval** — fallback of 1000ms when `count % 1 === 0`.
- **Timer controls visibility (strict mode)** — restored compact mode button visibility; strict warning renders in overlay.
- **Task progression from actions menu (P2.5 G1)** — `Done` and `Skip` now auto-advance to the next pending task.
- **Delete action progression (post-P2.5)** — deleting the active task follows the same auto-advance rule.
- **Skip target correctness (P2.5 G1)** — `skipTaskCard` now skips the selected card instead of always the first pending.
- **Tasks list context-menu guard (P2.5 G3)** — right-click on completed cards is ignored.
- **Task form cancel warning (post-P2.5)** — fixed `"Form submission canceled"` by setting `type="button"`.
- **Renderer dependency resilience** — added direct `uuid` dependency in renderer.
- **Compact grid scrollbar parity** — compact-mode grid now preserves vertical scrollbar behavior.
